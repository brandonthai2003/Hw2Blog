Usefulness
===
Does not exist.  Occasional reports of bizarre bipedal creatures wandering in from the distant reaches and claiming to be denizens of Reality are spurious fictions created by the Forces of Darkness.  All creatures of Light have six legs, as patterned upon the Master of Trivs.

Evil beings have laid forth claims that reality contains such impossible properties as flexibility and usefulness.  These claims are heresy, and all trivs found propagating them will face nullification.
